# Why Containers?

Containers package applications with their dependencies, providing consistency across environments and efficient resource utilization. They solve the "works on my machine" problem by ensuring applications run identically in development, testing, and production.

## Key Benefits

- **Portability**: Run anywhere - laptop, datacenter, cloud
- **Efficiency**: Share OS kernel, minimal overhead
- **Isolation**: Each container runs independently
- **Speed**: Start in seconds, not minutes
- **Consistency**: Same environment everywhere
