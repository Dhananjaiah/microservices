# Scaling Out a Cluster

Scaling out adds nodes to increase cluster capacity for more workloads. This enables horizontal scaling and better resource distribution.

## Methods

- Manual node addition
- Cluster Autoscaler (cloud environments)
- Node pools in managed Kubernetes

## Considerations

- Resource capacity planning
- Pod scheduling to new nodes
- Network configuration
- Storage availability

## Labs

- [Lab 01: Add Worker Node (kind)](labs/lab-01.md)
- [Lab 02: Observe Pod Distribution](labs/lab-02.md)
