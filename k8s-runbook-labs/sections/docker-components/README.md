# Docker Components

Docker consists of the Docker Engine (daemon), Docker CLI client, images (read-only templates), containers (running instances), and registries (image storage). Understanding these components is essential for containerization.

## Core Components

- **Docker Engine**: Server that creates and manages containers
- **Docker Images**: Read-only templates with application code
- **Docker Containers**: Running instances of images
- **Dockerfile**: Text file with build instructions
- **Docker Registry**: Storage and distribution system (Docker Hub, etc.)
