# Managing Containers at Scale

Manually managing containers becomes impractical at scale. Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes automate deployment, scaling, networking, and lifecycle management across clusters.

## Challenges Without Orchestration

- **Manual scaling**: Tedious to start/stop containers across hosts
- **No self-healing**: Failed containers require manual intervention
- **Service discovery**: Hard to track which containers are where
- **Load balancing**: Manual configuration for distributing traffic
- **Rolling updates**: Complex to update without downtime

## Need for Orchestration

Kubernetes provides automated container orchestration with features like auto-scaling, self-healing, service discovery, and rolling deployments.
